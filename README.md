> **⚠️ Work in Progress** - Strategic workspace for mindful professionals

A professional strategic planning tool that helps knowledge workers visualize project priorities and bring consciousness to their deep work sessions through elegant neo-brutalist design.

## 🎯 Objectives

**Core Mission**: Create the strategic meta-layer above task management tools - not managing details, but understanding the bigger picture and focus patterns.

**Two Core Functions**:
- **STRATEGIC MAP**: Visual project overview using cost/benefit positioning - see everything at once, understand trade-offs
- **DEEP FOCUS**: Mindful work sessions with post-session awareness - understand your patterns, improve your practice

**Target**: Motivated knowledge workers who appreciate visual organization and want Strava-like feedback for their productivity patterns.

## ✅ Current Progress (Phases 1-4D Complete)

### Foundation & Service Layer ✅
- ✅ **Next.js 15 + React 19** - Modern tech stack with TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ **Supabase Integration** - Complete database schema (11 tables) with RLS policies  
- ✅ **Authentication System** - Combined landing/login with user profile creation
- ✅ **Service Layer** - BULLETPROOF service architecture with coordinate collision detection

### Core Functionality Operational ✅
- ✅ **Complete CRUD System** - Project lifecycle with 11-field creation, editing, completion, XP tracking
- ✅ **DeepFocus Timer System** - High-precision sessions with willpower assessment and persistence
- ✅ **Capture Triage Workflow** - GTD-style brain dump → project conversion pipeline operational
- ✅ **Analytics Data Visualization** - Real-time charts with Recharts integration
- ✅ **XP System** - Formulas operational: `(10 + duration×0.5) × willpower_multiplier` & `cost × benefit × 10 × boss_multiplier`
- ✅ **Boss Battle Mechanics** - Atomic operations with 2x XP multiplier
- ✅ **Achievement System** - 10 achievements with automatic unlock detection

### UI Implementation ✅
- ✅ **Neo-Brutalist Design System** - 4 painting themes with CSS custom properties
- ✅ **Universal Components** - Header with capture bar (CMD+K), XP display, navigation grid
- ✅ **TacticalMap** - Complete cost/benefit matrix with project visualization and interactions
- ✅ **DeepFocus** - Session timer with 4 modals, willpower tracking, difficulty quotes
- ✅ **Analytics** - Data dashboard with heatmaps, charts, personal records, achievements

**Current Status**: All core workflows functional, real-time data integration complete

## 🎨 Phase 5: UI Refinement (Current Priority)

### Systematic Visual Enhancement
- 🎯 **TacticalMap Polish** - Professional grid refinement, improved project nodes, modal enhancement
- [ ] **DeepFocus Polish** - Minimalist timer interface, refined session modals
- [ ] **Analytics Polish** - Enhanced chart styling, professional data presentation  
- [ ] **Universal Components** - Cross-painting consistency and accessibility
- [ ] **Prime Scaffolding** - Future-ready interface preparation

**Focus**: Sequential painting refinement for production-ready professional sophistication

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Post-MVP Features
- [ ] **Prime Page** - Daily reflection with AI voice agent integration
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics** - Deeper productivity insights and patterns
- [ ] **Team Features** - Shared workspaces and collaboration tools
- [ ] **Mobile App** - Native iOS/Android for capture and session tracking

### AI Integration
- [ ] **Voice Logging** - Friction-free reflection capture
- [ ] **Pattern Recognition** - AI-driven productivity insights
- [ ] **Smart Suggestions** - Personalized project prioritization

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui v4, Framer Motion v11

**Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright (via MCP)  
**Deployment**: Vercel (planned)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Supabase account (free tier sufficient for development)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone [repository-url]
cd production-rebellion
npm install

# Environment setup
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your Supabase credentials

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Neo-Brutalism**: Bold, functional design with strong shadows and monochromatic color schemes per "painting"
- **TacticalMap**: Yellow/black/grey palette
- **DeepFocus**: Distinct monochromatic scheme  
- **Analytics**: Data-driven visualization focus

**Solo-Dev Humor**: Error messages follow acknowledgment + explanation + workaround pattern with self-aware humor.

## 📊 Quality Metrics

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, zero compilation errors
- **Testing**: 92% pass rate, targeting 95%+ coverage
- **Performance**: <2s page loads, 60fps animations
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
