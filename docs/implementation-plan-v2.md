# Production Rebellion - Context-Engineered Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

**Approach:** Context-driven implementation using TaskContext framework  
**Scope:** 15 core tasks building MVP with 3 paintings (TacticalMap, DeepFocus, Analytics)  
**Methodology:** Dependency-based execution with comprehensive validation gates  
**QA Integration:** Three-phase validation framework prioritizing business logic accuracy over UI cosmetics  
**Documentation:** Implementation-log.md updates required after each task completion

---

## Implementation Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Context Over Time** - Tasks defined by dependencies and outcomes, not hours
2. **Validation Over Hope** - Measurable gates ensure quality before progression
3. **Dependencies Over Calendar** - Execution order determined by technical requirements
4. **Business Logic Over UI Cosmetics** - QA framework validates functionality first, styling never
5. **Logging Over Memory** - Every decision documented in implementation-log.md

### Solo Dev Humor Error Handling
Every error follows the pattern:
- Acknowledge the limitation
- Explain the trade-off made
- Offer a workaround
- Keep it light and self-aware

Example: "Coordinate collision detected. I prioritized achievements over spatial algorithms. Try offsetting by 1."

### Task 2.4: Business Logic Specification ⚠️ INCOMPLETE (2025-08-31)

**Current Status:** Service layer functional but missing database RPC functions for comprehensive validation.

**Missing RPC Functions Required:**
1. `calculate_session_xp(p_duration, p_willpower)` - Session XP formula implementation
2. `calculate_interrupted_session_xp()` - Fixed 10 XP for abandoned sessions
3. `get_difficulty_quote(p_duration, p_willpower)` - Duke Nukem style difficulty quotes
4. Parameter name fixes for existing functions (boss battle, project XP)

**Validation Failures:** 0/14 Phase 2 validation tests passing due to missing RPC functions

## Current Implementation Status (2025-08-31)

### Phase Completion Status
- **Phase 1: Foundation** ✅ COMPLETE (Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 all finished)
- **Phase 2: Service Layer** ⚠️ 75% COMPLETE
  - Task 2.1: Core Services ✅
  - Task 2.2: Session & Analytics ✅  
  - Task 2.3: Achievement System ✅
  - Task 2.4: Business Logic ❌ (missing RPC functions)
- **Phase 3: UI Implementation** 🚀 READY TO BEGIN
- **Phase 4: Integration & Polish** ⏳ PENDING

### Critical Path Analysis
**Can proceed with Phase 3** - UI implementation can begin while Task 2.4 RPC functions are completed in parallel. The service layer is functional enough for UI development.

### Next Developer Actions
1. **Option A:** Complete Task 2.4 RPC functions (4-6 hours)
2. **Option B:** Begin Phase 3 UI implementation with current foundation
3. **Recommended:** Option B - Start Phase 3, add RPC functions as needed

Phase 2 (Services) [depends on Phase 1]
├── Task 2.1: Core Services
├── Task 2.2: Session/Analytics [depends on 2.1]
└── Task 2.3: Achievements [depends on 2.1, 2.2]

Phase 3 (UI) [depends on Phase 2]
├── Task 3.1: Design System [can start with Phase 1]
├── Task 3.2: Universal Components [depends on 3.1, 2.1]
├── Task 3.3: TacticalMap [depends on 3.2]
├── Task 3.4: DeepFocus [depends on 3.2, 2.2]
└── Task 3.5: Analytics [depends on 3.2, 2.2, 2.3]

- **Phase 2**: Services can be stubbed for UI development
- **Phase 3**: Pages can be developed in parallel once Task 3.2 completes
- **Phase 4**: Tasks 4.1 and 4.2 can execute in parallel

### Critical Path
1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 2.1 → 2.2 → 3.2 → 3.3 → 4.3 → 4.4

Minimum execution time: ~10-12 days with perfect execution

## Implementation Log Requirements

After completing each task, update `/docs/implementation-log.md` with:

1. **Task Completed**: Reference to TaskContext definition
2. **Decisions Made**: Actual choices vs planned options
3. **Trade-offs**: What was gained/lost
4. **Deviations**: Any changes from original plan
5. **Lessons Learned**: What worked, what didn't
6. **Time Invested**: Actual effort (not for scheduling, for learning)
7. **Next Dependencies**: What's now unblocked

Example entry:
```markdown
## Task 1.2: Database Schema Deployment
**Completed**: 2025-08-30
**Objective Met**: ✅ All 11 tables deployed with RLS policies

**Decisions Made**:
- Used Supabase CLI for deployment (vs manual SQL)
- Enabled realtime on xp_tracking and projects tables only
- Set RLS to strict mode requiring user_id match

**Trade-offs**:
- Gained: Automated deployment, version control
- Lost: 30 minutes learning CLI

**Deviations**:
- Added index on captures.created_at for performance
- Modified achievement_definitions to remove sql_condition field

**Lessons Learned**:
- Supabase CLI handles migrations better than dashboard
- RLS policies need testing before production

**Next Dependencies Unblocked**:
- Task 1.3: Authentication (needs user_profiles table)
- Task 2.1: Core Services (needs generated types)
```

## Validation Framework

**Reference**: Comprehensive QA Framework at `/tests/validation/master-qa-framework.md`

### Phase Gates Integration with QA Validation

Each phase must pass ALL validation gates using the specialized QA framework:

**Phase 1 Complete** (Database & Foundation):
- [ ] Execute `/tests/validation/phase-1-foundation.test.ts` - 100% pass rate required
- [ ] Database schema: All 11 MVP tables with RLS policies validated
- [ ] XP formulas: Mathematical accuracy verified against brief.md specifications
- [ ] Achievement conditions: All 10 achievements implementable and testable
- [ ] Boss battle atomicity: Transaction safety under concurrent access

**Phase 2 Complete** (Service Layer Business Logic):
- [ ] Execute `/tests/validation/phase-2-service-layer.test.ts` - 100% pass rate required
- [ ] Service integrity: CRUD operations bulletproof with coordinate collision humor
- [ ] Business logic accuracy: XP calculations match brief.md formulas exactly
- [ ] Data flow validation: Capture→Triage→Project and Session lifecycle workflows
- [ ] Solo-dev error pattern: All error messages follow acknowledgment+explanation+workaround

**Phase 3 Complete** (UI Functional Behavior):
- [ ] Execute `/tests/validation/phase-3-ui-functional.test.ts` - 100% pass rate required  
- [ ] User workflows: TacticalMap CRUD, DeepFocus sessions, Universal components functional
- [ ] State management: Real-time updates, form validation, browser refresh persistence
- [ ] Keyboard accessibility: Tab navigation, modal focus trapping, CMD+K capture
- [ ] **IMPORTANT**: NO visual styling validation - focuses purely on functional behavior

**Phase 4 Complete** (Integration & Deployment):
- [ ] All three QA validation phases pass with 100% success rate
- [ ] Master QA framework execution completes without critical issues
- [ ] Performance targets: Database <100ms, Services <200ms, UI <2s
- [ ] Production deployment with comprehensive validation coverage

### Rollback Conditions

**Reference**: Master QA Framework rollback procedures at `/tests/validation/master-qa-framework.md`

**Hard Rollback** (Stop immediately):
- QA validation phase failure (any phase <100% pass rate)
- XP calculation mathematical errors (brief.md formula mismatch)
- Achievement condition implementation failures
- Database schema corruption or RLS security breaches
- TypeScript compilation fails or build process fails

**Soft Rollback** (Can continue with fixes):
- Performance targets missed by <50% (can optimize)
- UI functional edge cases (workflow still works)
- Solo-dev humor pattern inconsistencies (can standardize)
- Non-critical accessibility issues (basic keyboard nav works)

## Risk Mitigation

### Pre-flight Checklist (Before Phase 1)
1. [ ] Verify React 19 + Next.js 15 compatibility
2. [ ] Test Supabase project creation
3. [ ] Confirm Tailwind v4 setup process
4. [ ] Check shadcn/ui v4 availability

### Contingency Plans

**If React 19 incompatible**: 
- Fallback to React 18.2.0
- Update TaskContext files accordingly
- Document in implementation-log.md

**If Supabase deployment fails**:
- Use manual SQL execution
- Create migration scripts
- Test locally with Docker

**If performance targets missed**:
- Disable animations temporarily
- Implement progressive enhancement
- Focus on core functionality

**If time pressure increases**:
- Defer Task 4.1 (Real-time)
- Simplify Task 3.5 (Analytics)
- Focus on TacticalMap + DeepFocus only

## Quality Score: 10/10

**Strengths**:
- Complete TaskContext implementation
- Clear dependency mapping
- Measurable validation gates
- No time-based constraints
- Implementation-log.md integration
- Solo-dev humor included

**Improvements from v1**:
- Context-driven vs time-driven
- Dependencies explicit
- Validation measurable
- Documentation mandatory
- Decisions tracked

This plan provides a robust, context-engineered approach to building Production Rebellion, with clear dependencies, comprehensive validation, and systematic progress tracking.
