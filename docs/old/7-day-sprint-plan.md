3. **Mobile Experience**: Complex interactions on small screens
   - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement and touch optimization
   
4. **Data Migration**: Schema changes during beta
   - **Mitigation**: Migration scripts and backward compatibility

### Contingency Plans
- **Critical Bug**: Rollback mechanism via Vercel deployments
- **Performance Issues**: Feature flags to disable expensive operations
- **Database Problems**: Read replicas and backup restoration procedures
- **User Overload**: Rate limiting and graceful degradation
