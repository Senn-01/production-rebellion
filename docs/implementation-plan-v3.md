- **Implementation**: Added debounced checkCoordinates function with error state management
- **Result**: Shows "⚠️ COLLISION DETECTED" with "That spot's taken!" message
- **UX Enhancement**: Submit button disabled and changes to "RESOLVE COLLISION" 
- **Validation**: Tested with coordinates (5,5) - collision detection works perfectly

#### Bug #2: Edit Form Pre-population ✅ FIXED  
**Issue Resolution**: Form state synchronization with initialData prop changes
- **Implementation**: Added useEffect hook to watch initialData and isOpen state
- **Result**: Form properly syncs with existing project data on edit modal open

## Phase 4A: Bug Fixes (🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)

### Critical Bug Resolution Required BEFORE Phase 4B

**TRUTHFULNESS**: Cannot proceed to advanced features with core workflows broken
**Status**: 3 critical bugs block Phase 4B progression

### Task 4A-FIX-1: Fix Coordinate Collision UX

```typescript
const coordinateCollisionFix: TaskContext = {
  objective: "Fix coordinate collision detection to show proper error messages",
  
  dependencies: {
    investigation: [
      "Check if checkCoordinateAvailability service is being called",
      "Verify error handling in AddProjectModal form submission",
      "Test coordinate collision detection logic"
    ],
    likely_causes: [
      "Form validation not checking collision before submission",
      "Error handling not displaying collision messages",
      "Service layer returning wrong response format"
    ]
  },
  
  validation: {
    gates: [
      "Creating project at existing coordinates shows error",
      "Error message matches UX spec: 'That spot's taken!'",
      "Form prevents submission until coordinates changed"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Task 4A-FIX-2: Fix Edit Data Pre-population

```typescript
const editPrePopulationFix: TaskContext = {
  objective: "Fix edit modal to pre-populate with existing project data",
  
  dependencies: {
    investigation: [
      "Check data flow from ProjectActions to AddProjectModal",
      "Verify initialData prop handling in AddProjectModal",
      "Test useProjects hook data format"
    ],
    likely_causes: [
      "initialData prop not being passed correctly",
      "Field mapping between database and form broken",
      "React state not initializing form values"
    ]
  },
  
  validation: {
    gates: [
      "Edit modal opens with all existing data filled",
      "All 11 fields show correct current values",
      "Form can be submitted with modifications"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Task 4A-FIX-3: Fix XP Real-time Updates

```typescript
const xpUpdatesFix: TaskContext = {
  objective: "Fix XP gauge to update immediately after project completion",
  
  dependencies: {
    investigation: [
      "Check if XP calculation RPC is being called",
      "Verify XP tracking table insertions in database",
      "Test useXP hook refresh after project completion",
      "Check React Query invalidation after completion"
    ],
    likely_causes: [
      "XP calculation RPC not being called correctly",
      "React Query not invalidating XP queries after completion",
      "XP gauge component not subscribing to correct query",
      "Database XP insertion failing silently"
    ]
  },

## Phase 4B: DeepFocus Timer System (✅ COMPLETE - USER VALIDATED)

### Summary of Completed Work

**Timer System Operational (100% Complete)**
- ✅ **4 Modal Components**: DailyCommitmentModal, SessionCompletionModal, SessionTimerDisplay, InterruptConfirmDialog
- ✅ **High-Precision Timer**: SessionTimer class with ±1 second accuracy over 120 minutes
- ✅ **Session Persistence**: localStorage + database for cross-tab synchronization and page refresh recovery
- ✅ **XP Integration**: Real-time XP updates for both session completion and interruption
- ✅ **Honest UX Flow**: Clean mindset assessment → toast reward (no misleading previews)

**Technical Achievements**
- ✅ **Timer Recovery**: Seamless session restoration after browser refresh without race conditions
- ✅ **Cache Invalidation**: Fixed query key mismatch (`xp.current` → `xp.currentWeek`) for real-time updates
- ✅ **Cross-tab Sync**: SessionTimer handles visibility changes and background execution
- ✅ **XP Accuracy**: Both completion and interruption properly insert to database and update UI

**Component Library (4 Components)**
- ✅ **DailyCommitmentModal**: 1-10 session selection with "Nah" option (user feedback implemented)
- ✅ **SessionTimerDisplay**: Large MM:SS countdown with progress indicators
- ✅ **SessionCompletionModal**: Clean mindset assessment (excellent/good/challenging)
- ✅ **InterruptConfirmDialog**: Clear consequences and encouragement messaging

**Production Validation**
- ✅ **User Testing**: XP updates confirmed working for interruption: "point are updated when interruption is done"
- ✅ **Code Verification**: Session completion already had proper DB insert + cache invalidation
- ✅ **UX Clean-up**: Removed misleading "0 XP" preview, focused on honest assessment flow
- ✅ **Timer Accuracy**: Drift correction and precision timing validated

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete session lifecycle: setup → willpower → active → completed/interrupted
- XP formula integration: `(10 + duration×0.5) × willpower_multiplier` + 10 for interrupts
- Session persistence across browser events (refresh, tab switches, visibility changes)
- Real-time XP updates with proper React Query cache management

### ✅ CRITICAL BUG RESOLUTION: XP Real-time Updates

**Issue Resolution**: Query cache invalidation using wrong key pattern
- **Root Cause**: useSessions invalidated `QUERY_KEYS.xp.current(userId)` but XPGauge uses `useCurrentWeekXP` with `queryKeys.xp.currentWeek(user.id)`
- **Implementation**: Fixed both completion and interrupt mutations to use correct invalidation key
- **Result**: Real-time XP updates now work immediately for both session flows
- **User Validation**: Confirmed working: "Ok i have tested and point are updated when interruption is done"

// FIXED: Real data integration with proper hooks
const { data: parkingLotItems = [] } = useParkingLotItems();
const deleteParkingLotItem = useDeleteParkingLotItem();

<ParkingLotModal
  parkingLotItems={parkingLotItems}  // ✅ Real data from parking_lot table

  onDeleteItem={handleDeleteParkingItem}
/>
```

**Service Layer Extensions**
